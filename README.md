# Clicky-Game
Coding Bootcamp Unit 19: React

### GitHub Pages Deployment:

#### Description: 
A memory game built with React. 

#### How to Use:
The user will start the game by clicking on the images displayed on the page.  The goal is to click each image only once.  After each click, the images will shuffle on the page.  

The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once per game.

While in the same session, the application will keep track of the top score.


#### Technical Approach:
Using Bootstrap for some basic front-end styling, the main focus is using React to render the images to the page and handling click events.  

* Technologies Used:
  - React
  - ReactDOM
  - Shuffle Array package
  - Bootstrap
